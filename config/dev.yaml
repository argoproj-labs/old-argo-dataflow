The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.\n# There are a few important trade-offs here:\n#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.\n#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.\n#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.\n# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or\n# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.\n\n# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk\n#log.flush.interval.messages=10000\n\n# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush\n#log.flush.interval.ms=1000\n\n############################# Log Retention Policy #############################\n\n# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can\n# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.\n# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens\n# from the end of the log.\n\n# https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-186%3A+Increase+offsets+retention+default+to+7+days\noffsets.retention.minutes=10080\n\n# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age\nlog.retention.hours=-1\n\n# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining\n# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.\n#log.retention.bytes=1073741824\n\n# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.\n#log.segment.bytes=1073741824\n\n# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according\n# to the retention policies\n#log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000\n\n############################# Zookeeper #############################\n\n# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).\n# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk\n# server. e.g. \"127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002\".\n# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the\n# root directory for all kafka znodes.\nzookeeper.connect=zookeeper:2181\n\n# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper\n#zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=6000\n\n\n############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################\n\n# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.\n# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.\n# The default value for this is 3 seconds.\n# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.\n# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.\n#group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0"
